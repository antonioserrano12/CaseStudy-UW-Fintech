* Name of company: Acorns

* When was the company incorporated? Feb 29, 2012

* Who are the founders of the company? Walter and Jeff Cruttenden

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? When Jeff Cruttenden was in college, he was surprised at how many of his peers had interest in investing but could not overcome the barriers in their way, such as high minimum balance requirements and fees. From that poin on, both father and son, sought to simplify investing and create a more realistic approach for young people to get started. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? According to Wikipedia, the company has raised approximately $100 million in venture capital funding by private investors like PayPal, Rakuten and Bain Capital.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? Simplify investing and create a more realistic approach for young people to get started. In general, people know how to save but investing still mystifies everybody mainly because it is not part of our common learning curve in money matters. By setting aside a few dollars here and there can add up to more than just a small pile of money. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) Acorns works via an app that is available for iOS and Android. Investors link their checking account to their Acorns' account so all the "spare change" from linked credit and debit card purchases is rounded up to the nearest dollar and invested in six different funds, based on the customer's tolerance.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Open Banking, Payment Processing and Capital Investment

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? With the advent of cloud computing and access to large amounts of historical data, it has been easier and cheaper for new entrants to bring alternatives to the traditional saving and investring products available by the incumbents. The new entrants have tackled problems that have been big barriers for consumers to access this products, such as high fees, commissions and minimum amounts of capital that were not available for young investors. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Stash, Gusto
