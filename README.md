### Apple Pay. Why this matters:

This is an important example of how a leading tech company is moving into consumer finance in a big way, using their existing iPh/iPad/Mac platform and existing Apple Store relationships to gain market share. And Apple Pay is hugely successful: well over a billion Apple Pay transactions took place in the second quarter of 2018, andmore mobile transactions took place that quarter using Apple Pay than PayPal.

Also notable are the reasons why Apple Pay is so successful, namely, that

- it seems to be more secure than a traditional credit card
- it is possible to store additional information that can be needed for certain transactions, such as driver's license information to verify age when purchasing alcoholic beverages.
